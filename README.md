# RPLog
## Description
This Mod is a simple Log Plugin, which logs Keywords which you can specify before handed and while Playing.
It saves the logs in sorted folders per Server and you can add a custom Keyword-List for each Server.
If no list is configured for a specific Server, the Mod uses the a default List which can also be edited independently.

## Versioning

### Release pattern
The mod is coded to be multi-version abroad the Minecraft version, categorised by the java version.
The current pattern uses following scheme: <j>.<x>.<y>.<z>
- j: java version in which this release can be used in
- x: major release version
- y: minor release version
- z: patch of minor release version

This means, the release 17.5.0.0 can be used in Minecraft \[1.18-1.20\] as all those use the Java Version 17
The release 21.5.0.0 can be used in \[1.21-tba\]

### Feature implementation 
The <x>.<y>.<z> releases have the same features implemented across the <j> version.
This means, the release 17.6.1.0 has a new feature and bug fix, which 21.5.0.0 does not have, even tho, 21 is greater than 17

### Older versions
Older versions are not multi-version thus don't have the java version tag and follow the feature pattern: <x>.<y>.<z>
Versions before 4.2.0 can only be Configured with Modmenu from Terraformers: [github][1] or [modrinth][2]

## History
This Mod was written by me to help specifically Roleplayers, which often access the logs of their RP History if their Server is text based.
In my Case it was Aegorin and all the people who make this Server what it is. To help them and to increase the fun and Quality of the Roleplay i started this Mod

If you want to check out the Server here you go: [Aegorin][5]
But keep in mind, that the Servers only language is German

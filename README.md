## Description
This Mod is a simple Log Plugin, which logs Keywords which you can specify before handed and while Playing.
It saves the logs in sorted folders per Server and you can add a custom Keyword-List for each Server.
If no list is configured for a specific Server, the Mod uses the a default List which can also be edited independently.

## Versioning

### Release pattern
The current pattern uses following scheme: \<m\>-\<x\>.\<y\>.\<z\>
- m: minecraft version
- x: major release version
- y: minor release version
- z: patch of minor release version

### Feature implementation 
The \<x\>.\<y\>.\<z\> releases have the same features implemented across the <m> version.
This means, the release <ins>1.18.2</ins>-**6.1.0** has a new feature and bug fix, which <ins>1.20.1</ins>-**5.0.0** does not have, even tho, 1.20 is newer

### Older versions
Versions before \<m\>-4.2.0 can only be Configured with Modmenu from Terraformers: [github][1] or [modrinth][2]

## Issues, Bugs or Crashes
If you experience any Crashes or Bugs open an [Issue][3] or join the [Discord][4]. 
I'm always happy to improve the mod, so send me ideas of what you think would be neat to add.

## History
This Mod was written by me to help specifically Roleplayer's, which often access the logs of their interaction history if their Server is text based.
In my Case it was Aegorin and all the people who make this Server what it is. I started this Mod to help them and to increase the fun and quality of this hobby. .

If you want to check out the Server here you go: [Aegorin][5]
But keep in mind, that the Servers only language is German
